# Add Another Cloudflare Account

> **How to use this file**
> Paste this into Claude Code in any folder when you need to register an additional Cloudflare account on a machine that already went through `setup-github-cloudflare.md`. Takes ~3 minutes.

---

## Your role, Claude

The user wants to register another Cloudflare account on this Mac, alongside any existing profiles. The base setup must already be done — the `cf-*` shell helpers exist, and at least one Cloudflare profile is in Keychain.

## Ground rules

1. Verify the base setup is in place before doing anything. If `cf-add` isn't a shell function, **halt** and direct the user to run `setup-github-cloudflare.md` first.
2. Pause for browser steps. Wait for the user to confirm before continuing.
3. Never echo the token to the terminal. `cf-add` already handles silent paste — do not bypass it.

---

## Phase 0 — Check prerequisites

Run:
```bash
type cf-add 2>&1 | head -1
cf-list
```

- `cf-add` should be reported as a shell function (e.g. `cf-add is a shell function`).
- `cf-list` should print at least one existing profile name.

If `cf-add` is unknown, **halt** and tell the user:
> "It looks like the base setup hasn't been done on this machine yet. Run `setup-github-cloudflare.md` first, then come back."

---

## Phase 1 — Pick a profile name

Ask the user: **"What short name do you want for this new account? Use lowercase, no spaces. Examples: `acme`, `client-bigco`, `agency`."**

Check for collisions by looking at the `cf-list` output you already have. If the chosen name already exists, ask:
> "A profile named `<name>` already exists. Replace it, or pick a different name?"

If replacing, run `cf-rm <name>` first. This only removes the entry from Keychain + `~/.config/cloudflare/profiles.conf` — the actual Cloudflare account is untouched.

---

## Phase 2 — Get credentials from Cloudflare

The user must be logged into the **right** Cloudflare account in their browser before creating the token. Open the token page:

```bash
open "https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens"
```

Tell the user:
> "Important: at the top-right of the dashboard, confirm you're on the account this profile is for. If not, switch accounts in the dropdown first.
>
> Then:
> 1. **Create Token** → **'Edit Cloudflare Workers'** template → *Use template*.
> 2. **Permissions** — the template already includes Workers Scripts: Edit, Workers KV Storage: Edit, Workers R2 Storage: Edit, Account Settings: Read, and Workers Routes: Edit (zone). Add these rows:
>    - **Account → Cloudflare Pages → Edit** (deploy/manage Pages projects)
>    - **Account → D1 → Edit** (D1 databases)
>    - **User → User Details → Read** — allows `wrangler whoami` to show your email; without this, wrangler will print a warning on every command. Not required for deploys, but recommended to keep the output clean.
> 3. **Account Resources** → *Include* → restrict to this specific account.
> 4. **Zone Resources** → 'All zones from an account' → this account.
> 5. **TTL** → 90 days.
> 6. **Continue to summary** → **Create Token**. Copy the token — shown only once.
> 7. The **Account ID** is in the right sidebar of any account page. Copy it too.
>
> Reply 'ready' when you have **both** copied."

Wait for "ready".

> Note: if `wrangler whoami` warns about a missing `User → User Details → Read` permission, edit the existing token in the dashboard to add it — no need to recreate the token or re-run `cf-add`.

---

## Phase 3 — Register the profile

```bash
cf-add <name>
```

`cf-add` prompts twice: account ID (visible paste), then token (silent — nothing echoes). On success: `✓ Profile '<name>' saved`.

---

## Phase 4 — Verify

```bash
cf-on <name>
npx --yes wrangler whoami
```

Confirm both:
- The output shows the **right** account name (different from any other profile's account).
- Authentication is token-based.

If `wrangler whoami` shows the wrong account, the token was likely created on the wrong Cloudflare account in the dashboard. Run `cf-rm <name>` and start Phase 2 over, paying attention to the account dropdown at the top-right of the dashboard.

Final clean-up:
```bash
cf-status     # should print "✓ Active: <name> (account: ...)"
cf-off
cf-list       # should print every profile, including the new one
```

---

## Wrap-up

Tell the user:
> "Profile `<name>` is registered. From now on, in any folder, run `cf-on <name>` before deploying or running wrangler commands and they'll target this account. Switch with `cf-on <other-name>`. Clear with `cf-off`. List all with `cf-list`."

Stop here.
